A handwritten note has been added to C10's label.

If you are a Charvis then this is a simple application of Xkrith's First and Sixth Theorems.  If you are not a Charvis then you 
should familiarize yourself with Xkrith's works.  A primer can be found in Room 100034B.

Note: For the humans out there, this system is built on an oscillator. It'll disable itself when you find the oscillator's 
fixed point.

Good luck!
