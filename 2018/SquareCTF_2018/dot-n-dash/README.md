# C1 : dot-n-dash 
You are the last person on planet Charvis 8HD. Everyone has decided to leave because Charvis 9HD is the hipper place to live. 
As 
the last person to leave, your Captain sent you the following instructions:

"Make sure you enable the Charvis 8HD Defense System (CDS) after taking off in your spaceship."

However, you misread the instructions and activated the CDS before leaving the planet. You are now stuck on this planet. Can 
you figure out how to manually disable the 10 defense systems (C1 thru C10) which comprise CDS in order to safely take off?

Thankfully, Charvis 8HD does not have strong dust storms and you will not need to travel 2,000 miles in a rover.
C1: dot-n-dash

The instructions to disable C1 were considered restricted. As a result, they were stored only in encoded form.

The code to decode the instructions was regrettably lost due to cosmic radiation. However, the encoder survived.

Can you still decode the instructions to disable C1?

dot-n-dash.jar) or using a graphical decompression tool.

Your browser may warn you that "this type of file can harm your computer" because jar files typically contain Java code.
